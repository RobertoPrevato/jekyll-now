### README ###

This directory contains base functions, defined with R.js, jQuery and UnderscoreJs.

These functions are independent from any web framework.

The Knight tools is able to sort scripts by dependencies defined using R.js,
to automatically generate <script> elements inside root-level .html files.

Knight supports multiple calls to R.js in a single file.

Another option is to defined modules and dependencies with comments:

//Module: name
//Deps: a, b, c, d

In this case, only one module per file can be defined.
