## Designer turned programmer

I am a graphic designer from the province of Turin (Italy) now working as DevOps and applications architect for financial services; husband of a wonderful musician who plays for the Polish folk group called Mazowsze. Fond of Philosophy, novels, underground music, visual arts and (mostly criminal) tv series. 

### Oh my, how did I become a programmer!?

After my studies at Polytechnic Institute of Torino, since I needed a personal web portfolio, I began studying server side coding and database development, and I found out that programming can be as much creative and fun as graphic and industrial design. While university studies gave me the basis of HTML, CSS, Web usability and a tiny bit of JavaScript, I studied all different aspects of web development on my own, to be able to build complex web applications working alone. Today I am expert in many server side and client side web frameworks, and proficient in several languages and database systems.

I had the luck to become fond of JavaScript few years before it became popular, when people still used to say: *"Why are you wasting your time with JavaScript? ActionScript is better!"*, and today single page applications are one of my specialties.
My knowledge of JavaScript is the reason why I am now living in Poland and I met my wife, so I can say it shaped my life!

Web development is my main job and my main hobby at the same time. I just feel sorry because I would like to have more free time to dedicate to 3d modeling, rendering and digital painting.

I love animals, especially cats and dogs, and I feel close to cats, for sensitivity and points of view.
Music is one of my greatest passions, although I am just a listener, and my music tastes are one of the reasons why some people think I am a weird guy. While I like classical music, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, I am also fond of rock, heavy metal, industrial metal, extreme metal genres (mostly black, funeral doom, sludge doom, drone doom), noise music, electronical and dark ambient. My favourite band is Sunn O))), and some of my favorite artists are (in random order): Rammstein, Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Old Time Relijun, Abruptum, Burzum, Mayhem, Gorgoroth, Velvet Cacoon, Death Spell Omega, Xasthur, Nortt, Khold, Meshuggah, Monarch, Khanate, Khlyst, Ataraxie, Sabazius, Attila Csihar, Lustmord, Henrik Nordvargr Björkk.

My favourite visual artists of past times are William Blake, Lucien Freud, Albrecht Dürer, Albert Pinkham, Alphonse Mucha, while among modern artists the first that come to my mind are like Stephen Kasner, Gerald Brom, Luis Royo, Hans Ruedi Giger.

I spend most of my free time reading (usually novels and philosophy books), riding a bike and trying to keep myself in a good shape.
I am fond of board games and used to play Dungeons&Dragons a lot (unfortunately I don't have time for it anymore), and I used to be a passionate videogames player.
